This project is focused on collecting data from sofascore.com, specifically targeting specific leagues rather than collecting data for all available leagues. The data collected includes information about teams and their respective matches within the specified leagues. The collected data can be used for various purposes such as analyzing team performance, tracking player statistics, and monitoring league trends.
