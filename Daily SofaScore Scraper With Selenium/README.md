This is a robust data collection project that involves the use of parallel scraping techniques to extract data from Sofascore. The project is designed to collect data on a daily basis, and it includes a feature for updating previously collected data. The scraping process involves opening multiple tabs to increase efficiency and ensure that the data is collected as quickly as possible. The collected data is then saved for future use, allowing for ongoing analysis and tracking of trends over time.
