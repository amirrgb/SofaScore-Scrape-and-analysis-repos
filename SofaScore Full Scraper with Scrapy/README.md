# sofascore.com_scraper
This project involves the creation of multiple spiders with various purposes to collect data from the Sofascore API. The spiders are designed to extract data on all football matches and store it in a JSON format. The collected data is then used to create structured data in SQL format for further analysis. 

To ensure up-to-date data, an updater spider is also included to monitor for changes in links and new matches. This ensures that the data collected remains relevant and accurate. The spider-based approach allows for efficient and automated data collection, saving time and effort compared to manual methods. 

Overall, this project enables the extraction and structuring of comprehensive football match data for in-depth analysis and insights.
